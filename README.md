# API Design Repository

Welcome to my **API Design** repository! 🚀 In this project, I've delved into the exciting world of API design using Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. Throughout the exploration, I covered a variety of essential topics to advance the art of crafting robust and scalable APIs.

## Topics Explored

- 🛣️ **Routes Composition**: I've learned how to structure and compose API routes effectively for better organization and maintainability.

- 🤲 **Routes Handlers**: Explored different strategies for handling HTTP requests and managing the flow of data through my API.

- ⚙️ **Async Processes**: Dived into asynchronous programming techniques to handle concurrent operations efficiently.

- 🚨 **Error Handling**: Understood best practices for handling errors gracefully to improve the reliability of my API.

- 🔐 **Authentication**: Implemented secure authentication mechanisms to protect my API and control access to resources.

- 🚀 **Deployment to Production**: Discovered the steps and considerations for deploying my API to a production environment for real-world usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for building scalable network applications.

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.

- **Prisma**: A modern database toolkit that makes database access and management simple.
